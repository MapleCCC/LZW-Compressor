- TODO: add max_len restriction to code dict
- TODO: reserve the last code of code dict as virtual EOF
- TODO: the testing doesn't cover the case that code dict grows beyond capacity.
- TODO: implement trie data structure to speedup performance
- TODO: profile to find performance bottleneck, and try to optimize
- TODO: add unit test
- TODO: consider rewriting in lazy evaluation / generator style, so as to save runtime space cost
- Another importance of writing in stream style is that so our script can handle input that is infinitely large
- TODO: handle the corner case of zero file is input for compression
- TODO: handle the corner case of empty file
- TODO: why is our encode output different with the example one?
- TODO: preserve newline format. Disable Python's builtin default universal newline support feature.
- TODO: ask for clarification of spec: should we handle the case of zero compressed file?
- TODO: hypothesis custom build strategy
